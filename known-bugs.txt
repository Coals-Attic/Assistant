To do:
ID
  1. describe: performs quick aggregation functions (count, mean, std, min, 25%,50%,75%,max)
  2. head: returns x amount of values from the head of the series
  3. tail: returns x amount of values from the tail of the series
  4. filter: returns all the series, except values that do not meet the condition
  5. hasNils: returns all the pairs of data (row, columns) in which X is nil
  6. Add proper adding functions
  8. Add a move() function
  9. Finish binary search, implement conditional binary indexing for both strings and numbers
  10. Implement ParameterCheck for all the functions and test it please
  11. When binary search is finished, do binary insertion sort in Assign.lua
  12. Implement combine to combine multiple columns within a sheet
  13. Implement join to join multiple columns and return the result
  14. Format real dataframe keys so they are numbers if they represent numbers

FIXED:
BUG-ID
  1. Print() has a bug where if the column label is too large, items get off (fixed 8/9/2020)
  3. Apparently, there's a bug relating 1D dataframes that makes data.column[1] actually the first item
      
      That is, 
      
      data = Sheet:new {
        data = {1,2,3}
      }

      If you index data as data.columns[2], the output is "2"
  6. Print somehow seems to not work properly with some items, 
     the data is there but the items just wont print (issue was related to labels, fixed)
  7. There's an issue with metadata in assign, so take care of that (fixed)
  4. Apparently, table.sort(labels) inside Assign() is sorting labels 
     that are clearly numbers like strings, which causes a jump from 1, to 10, to 100, and 101...
