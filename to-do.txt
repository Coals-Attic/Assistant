TODO!!!!

-- Row naming is broken
-- Reason: When picking an item using select(), the item does not
           inherit the pointers defined for the parent, that is,
           the item picked will have raw indices 

           (like "1", "2" instead of "customer_name", "purchases")

-- Fix ideas
-- (?): Maybe edit the select() function a little bit so it passes the pointers
-- (?): Harder but total, edit the pointer() function so that every item in the column is linked
        (easier with a "get()" function that does the indexing)

        >> picked to do both choices, as pointers should work within the very index metamethod
           instead of some kind of function that just resends you the item

           a "get()" function might be useful in the future, as well as for a leaner syntax
