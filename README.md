## What is Assistant?

Assistant is a data science library, *written entirely in Lua.*

Assistant provides you with a sheet class (dataframe) and a complete
toolkit of functions you can use to transform the data and visualize it
via plotting

Everything in Assistant is simple and powerful, it can also integrate with Torch for machine learning
